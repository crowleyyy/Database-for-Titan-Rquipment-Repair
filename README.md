# Database For Titan Equipment Repair

Welcome to the Database For Titan Equipment Repair! This database is designed to manage information about forklift repairs and maintenance. It helps track forklifts, their service history, and the parts needed for repair.

## Database Structure

The database consists of the following tables:

### Authentication Table

- `Users` table:
  - `user_id` (Primary Key)
  - `username`
  - `password`

### Equipment Table

- `Equipment` table:
  - `serial_number` (Primary Key)
  - `last_service_date`
  - `last_service_done`
  - `next_pnm_date`
  - `needs_parts` (ENUM: "True", "False", "Part ordered")
  - `parts_name`
  - `parts_arrived` (ENUM: "True", "False", "N/A")
  - `location_id` (Foreign Key)

### Location Table

- `Location` table:
  - `location_id` (Primary Key)
  - `name`
  - `address`
  - `phone_number`

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and the database structure may change in future iterations. We are continuously refining and improving the database to better serve the needs of Titan Equipment Repair.

Each entry in the `Equipment` table is associated with a specific `location_id` from the `Location` table for future workflow.
